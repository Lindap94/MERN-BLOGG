      <p className='summary'>It’s not exactly a powerhouse in terms of cooling or heating, but for a portable, battery-powered unit, the upgraded EcoFlow Wave 2 is a welcome breath of fresh (or hot) air. With the add-on battery, it can run for up to 8 hours on a charge, and at 14 kg (33 lb), it’s reasonably portable as well.

The heating/cooling unit packs 5,100 BTUs of cooling and 6,100 BTUs of heating — on par with an entry-level window AC unit. It’s enough to cool or heat a room or a small space such as an RV — assuming the RV itself is well insulated.</p>
